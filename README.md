# AtliQ Hospitality Analytics

This repository contains the project files for the Atliq Grands Hospitality Analytics project. Atliq Grands, a prominent player in India's hospitality sector, faced challenges in the luxury business hotel segment. This project aims to address those challenges by incorporating data-driven strategies and business intelligence.

## Problem Statement

Atliq Grands operates several top-rated hotels throughout India and boasts a two-decade presence in the hospitality sector. Recently, due to competitive strategies and managerial missteps, the company has seen a decline in its market position and earnings within the upscale and business hotel segment. Recognizing the need for a turnaround, the managing director of Atliq Grands aims to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" to recapture lost market share and revenue. Unfortunately, the company currently lacks an internal data analytics team capable of furnishing such critical insights.

The revenue management team opted to engage a third-party service provider to extract insights from their historical data.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to enhance Atliq Grands' market share and revenue in the luxury business hotel sector. The company intends to outperform competitors and improve management decisions by utilizing data-driven strategies and business intelligence.
